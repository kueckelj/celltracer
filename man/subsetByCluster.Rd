\title{Create data subset by cluster}
\usage{
subsetByCluster(
  object,
  new_name,
  cluster_variable,
  cluster,
  phase = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid celltracer object.}

\item{new_name}{Character value. Denotes the name of the output object. If set to NULL the name of the
input object taken and suffixed with \emph{'_subset'}.}

\item{cluster_variable}{Character value. Denotes cluster variable from which
to subset the cells.}

\item{cluster}{Character vector. Denotes the exact cluster names carried by the
cluster variable specified with argument \code{cluster_variable} to be kept.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}
}
\value{
A celltracer object that contains the data for the subsetted cells.
}
\description{
Subset functions allow to conveniently split your data by certain characteristics such
as cell lines, conditions, cluster etc. or for specific cell ids. This might be useful if you want apply some machine learning
techniques such as clustering and correlation on only a subset of cells. See details for more information.
}
\details{
Creating subsets of your data affects analysis results such as clustering and correlation which
is why these results are reset in the subsetted object and must be computed again. To prevent inadvertent overwriting
the default directory is reset as well. Make sure to set a new one via \code{setDefaultDirectory()}.

The mechanism with which you create the subset is stored in the output object. Use \code{printSubsetHistory()}
to reconstruct the way from the original object till the current one.
}
\note{
In case of experiment set ups with multiple phases:

As creating subsets of your data affects downstream analysis results you have to
manually specify the phase for which the clustering of interest has been calculated.

The output object contains data for all phases but only for those cells that matched
the input for argument \code{cluster} in the specified cluster variable during
the specified phase.
